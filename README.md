# 🎬 Easy Remote Media Converter

Convert your **media files remotely** — simple, fast and hardware-accelerated.

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Easy Remote Media Converter** is an open-source project designed to make remote video and audio conversion effortless.  
It allows you to send media files to another machine (Linux, Unraid, or Windows) where conversion is done automatically using your hardware (GPU or CPU).

No complicated setup, no deep technical knowledge required — the goal is simplicity and flexibility.

## ⚙️ Core concept

This project connects the dots between existing open-source tools to create a lightweight, distributed conversion system.  
It relies on well-known, stable components like **FFmpeg** (for media processing) and supports multiple hardware backends (NVIDIA, Intel, AMD, or CPU fallback).

All configuration and automation logic are transparent — users can adapt or extend it as they wish.

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide an easy way to **convert media files remotely** across your network  
- Offer **hardware acceleration** support for faster processing  
- Keep everything **open, lightweight, and scriptable**  
- Serve as a **foundation** for advanced users or studios who want to build their own encoding infrastructure

## 💡 Philosophy

Most existing media converters are heavy, closed, or platform-locked.  
**Easy Remote Media Converter** takes the opposite approach:  
it’s designed to be free, transparent, and adaptable — a tool that bridges the gap between home users and professional setups.
